        <strong>Hello, I'm Mike.</p></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm a full stack software engineer, programmer, technology enthusiast, father, swimmer, kayaker, and hiker from Rochester, NY. Currently I work full time as a Senior Full Stack Software Engineer at
        <a href="https://www.mindex.com/" target="_blank">Mindex</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Software design and system architecture are important to me.  I love solving difficult problems utilizing todays fast evolving technology. People tell me I have an endless appetite to learn. Bottom line is I love what I do and a lot of what I know is self taught.
        I am always looking to get my feet wet learning something new and learning how to do it correctly and efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally I am an avid Steelers fan and am often seen waving my terrible towel cheering on the black and gold.
