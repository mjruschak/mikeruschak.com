These days a lot of my spare time goes into managing [Fitmotivation](https://fitmotivation.com).  I love working on this project because it provides me a platform to spread my wings.  However, I will be releasing more small projects this year once I clean them up.  At that point I will update this page accordingly.

Recently I have decided to use my own self hosted Git hosting in addition to GitHub.  This way if GitHub goes in a negative direction I can abandon it.  I have chosen and am currently using Gogs and like it so far.  You can see my repositories [here](https://git.mikeruschak.com).

## Client Projects
As of 2018 I have given up all freelance projects except for Fitmotivation.  This site is one of my proudest accomplishments and would rather dedicate my time to it.

### Fitmotivation

This web site that launched in 2014, offers streaming fitness videos for Aquatic Fitness Trainers.  Trainers can get new ideas from the videos and can even comment. I architected, designed and built the entire system.  The backend consists of a REST API so that we can eventually support other mediums. One possibility would be a mobile application.  The frontend is built using AngularJS, and I am currently working to migrate to Vue.js this year.  Vue.js is lean and learned a lot of lessons from Angular and React.  PostgresSQL is used for the backend database for the site.
