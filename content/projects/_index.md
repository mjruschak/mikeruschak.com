These days a lot of my spare time goes into managing [Fitmotivation](https://fitmotivation.com) and [Poolfit](https://poolfit.tv).  I love working on these projects because it provides a platform to spread my wings.  However, I will be releasing more small projects this year once I clean them up.  At that point I will update this page accordingly.

### Poolfit
Launched in 2018 and offers streaming fitness videos for consumers to workout in their own pools. The product has a REST API, Android App, iOS App, and Web Site (Vue.JS Frontend).

### Fitmotivation
This web site that launched in 2014, offers streaming fitness videos for Aquatic Fitness Trainers.  Trainers can get new ideas from the videos and can even comment. I architected, designed and built the entire system.  The backend consists of a REST API so that we can eventually support other mediums. One possibility would be a mobile application.  The frontend is built using Vue.js.
